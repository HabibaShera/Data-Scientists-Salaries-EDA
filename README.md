# Data Scientist Salaries

The project is about salaries of data scientists, machine learning enginners, data analysts, data engineers, etc.


## Challenges
- The categories of job titles are a lot. I used the FuzzyWuzzy module to make these many categories into 5 categories.
- There are outliers in data. I replaced them with the median
- There are many categories in some columns else and not frequency a lot, so I replace them with "other"
